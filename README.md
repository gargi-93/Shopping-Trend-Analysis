# Shopping-Trend-Analysis

This project analyzes apparel shopping search interest using Google Trends data to identify long-term demand patterns, seasonal behavior, and year-over-year (YoY) growth across product categories.

A folder-based Power BI pipeline was built using Power Query to clean, combine, and normalize multiple Google Trends CSV files, enabling a refreshable and scalable time-series dashboard.

## Project Objective
To understand how consumer interest in apparel categories evolves over time and to uncover:
- Seasonal demand patterns
- High-performing and emerging categories
- Year-over-Year growth trends

## Data Source
- Google Trends (downloaded separately for each apparel keyword)

 **Note:** Google Trends reflects *relative search interest*, not actual sales demand.
 

## Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI** – dashboard development and visualization  
- **Power Query** – data cleaning, transformation, and folder-based ingestion  
- **DAX** – calculated measures (YoY growth, averages, KPIs)  
- **CSV** – raw data inputs  

## Key Features
- Folder-based data ingestion for easy data refresh
- Time-series analysis of apparel search interest
- Category-level comparison of average interest
- Year-over-Year (YoY) growth analysis
- Seasonal demand pattern visualization

## Key Insights
- Certain apparel categories show strong and consistent seasonal patterns
- Some categories demonstrate steady YoY growth, indicating rising consumer interest
- Search interest varies significantly across years, highlighting trend shifts
